## Design Decisions

- **State Management**: The `provider` package was chosen for state management due to its simplicity and scalability.
- **Dynamic Layouts**: Portrait mode prioritizes fullscreen video playback for better viewing, while landscape mode combines video and comments for efficient multitasking.
- **Comment Timestamp Markers**: Added to enhance user navigation and link comments directly to specific moments in the video.

## Conclusion
The  Review Video Platform app provides a clean and interactive interface for video playback and user role-specific commenting functionality. With responsive layouts and advanced features like timestamp-based comments, it is ideal for video collaboration or review workflows.
